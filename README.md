# nand2tetris
Nand to Tetris is a research project cum course which is available on coursera offered by Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The project consists of fourteen subprojects in which each project is to be done per week. The idea of the project is to build a fully functioning virtual computer from the basic building block i.e a nand gate. The process is to build basic chips like adder,MUX,ALU,RAMS etc. in a Hardware description language and testing in a Hardware Simulator provided in nand2tetris sofware suite which is freely available on the course website.This course is designed in such a way that after completing every week we create a level of abstraction and while working on the next subproject we can talk to the interface of abstracted levels that we created in previous subprojects. Once we build the hardware layer we can then build the software layer which consists of building an assembly language, a operating system, a compiler, a programming language and an application in that programming language like tetris. Thus it is named nand2tetris.
